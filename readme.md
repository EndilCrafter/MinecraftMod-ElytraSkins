Elytra Skins is a mod that add different skins for elytras.

## Description

All custom elytras can be crafted at a regular crafting table with a normal elytra and some other items.

* Vex wings are dropped by Vexes
* Allay wings can be found inside chests in Pillager Outposts
* The Dragon elytra is crafted with dragon scales and requires [Quark](https://github.com/VazkiiMods/Quark) to be installed
* Parrot feathers are obtained by hitting parrots without holding tools or weapons
* Bat wings are dropped by bats

Different elytra skins don't offer any advantage in durability or flight speed.
The difference is purely cosmetic.
